# Hospital-Management-System
Database Development - MySQL

This repository is dedicated to my final project for the course of "Database Management and Database Design" at Northeastern University, Boston, MA.

This is a database created in MySQL using MySQL workbench for the purpose of storing Hospital data in the form of rows and columns, hence it is called as the "Hospital Management System Database". 

The repository consists a total of 11 files out of which 10 files are Visual Studio Code files highlighting different aspects of Data Modelling using MySQl programming language for MySQL database "Hospital Managent System Database". They are present with an extension ".sql". The files cover forward engineering, reverse engineering, creation of functions, triggers, stored procedures etc.

The file named "Hospital_Management_System_MySQL_Complete" is the complete Database Model built using MySQl Workbench. The main purpose of this file is to demonstrate how different components/modules of the database are connected with each other, what are their primary keys, foreign keys, secondary keys, different constraints set for each module such as "not null" etc.
